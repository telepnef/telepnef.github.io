<h3 class="bar">Visiting Everest's Tibet Base Camp </h3>
<p class="rab"><strong>At the base camp</strong> , apart from the tents of mountaineers doing their acclimatization, there are huts and a post office where people can mail postcards to themselves or others as a precious souvenir.

Everest is 20 km (13 mi) south up a gravel plain in a glacial valley. The valley floor is generally featureless and gray, apart from boulders and small ponds, but it's the imposing snow-capped mountains around it that visitors come to see. </p>
